# Intraday Volatility Paper (Draft)

This folder contains the research paper and supporting figures.

This draft will import figures generated under `paper/figs/` by `experiments/run.py`.

## Overview
The paper synthesizes findings from experiments and research notes into a formal document.  

## Structure
- `draft.md`: Working draft of the paper.
- `figs/`: Generated figures, created by `experiments/run.py`.

## Purpose
Provide a clear narrative of:
- The modeling approach for intraday volatility monitoring
- Comparative performance across detectors

## Outputs
